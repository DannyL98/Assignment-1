#Part 1:Chicken weights
###_________________________________________________________________________________________

#### Null hypothesis: There is no relationship between chicken feed and the rate of growth.
#### Alternative hypothesis: There is a relationship between chicken feed and rate of growth.  
#### Stat Test : A  ANOVA with pairwise post-hoc test will be performed based and the following assumptions that underlie the analysis... 
#####
####->There are three or more groups being compared.
####->The data collected is continues (interval data)
###_________________________________________________________________________________________
##Chunk 1
```{r Chicken_weights, echo=TRUE}

library(readr)
library(mosaic)
library(lattice)
library(datasets)
library(Matrix)
library(mosaicData)

chick_weights <- read_csv("C:/Users/LORD DANNICUS/Desktop/chick-weights.csv")
View(chick_weights)

cw <- read.csv("C:/Users/LORD DANNICUS/Desktop/chick-weights.csv", 
                 header = TRUE)

print.data.frame(cw)

#1-Shows how the different feeds affect chick weight.
boxplot(weight~reorder(feed,weight,median), data=chickwts, main="Boxplot showing Feed vs. chick weight", xlab="Feed", ylab="Chick weight at six weeks (g)")

#2-Descriptive statistics of data set.
favstats(weight~feed, data=chickwts)

#3-ANOVA test which tests for significatnts
chickmodel=lm(weight~feed, data=chickwts)
anova(chickmodel)

summary(chickmodel)

#4-Post-hoc test which corrects (x)\ for mutiple comparisoons which avoids type 1 error
pairwise.t.test(chickwts$weight, chickwts$feed,
                p.adjust.method = 'holm',
                paired = FALSE)

```
##Data interpretation:
####According to the ANOVA, chicken feed has a significant effect on chichen growth rate where p < 0.001 which is obtained from F-statistics. The Post-Hoc test tells us that sunflowerer and  casien fed chicks can grouped separately from horsebean, soybean and linseed fed chicks. On the other hand  linseed fed chicks can be grouped separetely from  horsebean but not meatmeal or soybean.

#Part 2:The hot Zone
###_________________________________________________________________________________________

#### Null hypothesis: Gastroenteritis is not caused by drinking contaminated water.
#### Alternative hypothesis: Gastroenteritis is caused by drinking contaminated water.  
#### Stat Test : A Chi-squared analysis test will be performed based and the following    assumptions that underlie the analysis... 
#####
####->There are two groups being compared (those that fell ill, and those that did not).
####->The data collected is nominal(non-arithmetic relationship) with either binary (2 categories) or categorical (>3 categories) values.
###_________________________________________________________________________________________
##Chunk 2
```{r The_hot_Zone, echo=TRUE}


library(dplyr)
library(readr)
library(likert)

gastroenteritis <- read_csv("C:/Users/LORD DANNICUS/Desktop/gastroenteritis.csv")
View(gastroenteritis)

gi <- read.csv("C:/Users/LORD DANNICUS/Desktop/gastroenteritis.csv", 
                 header = TRUE)

#1-'print.data.frame(gi)' allows us to visalise the complete dataset consisting of 1094 patients, for practicallity I just included the the first and last six patient measurements.   
head(gi)
tail(gi)

#2-Contingency table for Chi-squared analysis.
gia <- table(gi$Outcome, gi$Consumption)
print(gia)

#3-Shows that gastroenteritis was caused in patients who ingested contaminated drinking water. The more glasses which were drank, the greater the likelihood of the disaese. 
barplot(gia,col = c("black", "grey"), main="Relation of waterconsumption to illness", xlab="Consumption", ylab = "Illness amongst pationts")
legend ('topleft', legend = c("Ill", "Not Ill"), fill = c("black", "grey"))

#4-Allows us to see whether the findings in the plot are significant.
chisq.test(gia)

```
##Data interpretation:
#### According to the data analysis, drinking contaminated water is significantly associated with the development of gastroenteritis (p < 0.001). 
###_________________________________________________________________________________________









#Part 3:Nausea
###_________________________________________________________________________________________

#### Null hypothesis: Nausea rating of patients receiving emetogenic chemotherapy was not higher before as compared to after administration of 5HT3- receptor blocker.
#### Alternative hypothesis: Nausea rating of patients receiving emetogenic chemotherapy was higher before as compared to after administration of 5HT3- receptor blocker.  
#### Stat Test : A Wilcoxon signed rank test will be performed based and the following    assumptions that underlie the analysis... 
#####
####->There are two measurements per individual.
####->Data is ordinal meaning that it is non-parametric.
###_________________________________________________________________________________________
##Chunk 3
```{r Nausea, echo=TRUE}



library(readr)
library(knitr
        )
library(readr)
nausea <- read_csv("C:/Users/LORD DANNICUS/Desktop/nausea.csv")
View(nausea)

na <- read.csv("C:/Users/LORD DANNICUS/Desktop/nausea.csv", 
                 header = TRUE)


#1- Patient eights reading of Nausea_after treatment negatively affects the spread of data and prevents us from performing the nessesary statistical test as a result it must be ommited
naa <- na[-8,]
print(na)

nab<- select (naa, Nausea_before, Nausea_after)

print(nab)

#2-Shows us that nausea before is higher as compared to after receptor blocker treatment.
boxplot(nab$Nausea_before, nab$Nausea_after,main = "Association between Nausea after 5HT3-receptor blocker treatment",names = c("Nausea_before", "Nausea_after")) 

#3-Tests for significants of results.
wilcox.test(nab$Nausea_before, nab$Nausea_after, paired = TRUE)


```
##Data interpretation:
#### According to the analysis of the data the alternative hypothesis is confirmed.Nausea rating of patients receiving emetogenic chemotherapy was indeed significanly higher (p = 0.04983) before as compared to after administration of 5HT3- receptor blocker.

#Assignment 5
###_________________________________________________________________________________________

#### Null hypothesis: There is no relationship between interest rate and house prices.
#### Alternative hypothesis: There is a relationship between interest rate and house prices.
#### Stat Test : A Linear Regression test will be performed based and the following    assumptions that underlie the analysis... 
#####
####->A linear trend shoud exist between both interest rate and hose prices.
####->The residuals should be normally distributed but should have the same variance for median house prices (homoskedasticy).
####->The data which has been collected should be continous.
###_________________________________________________________________________________________
##Chunk 1
```{r Housing_prices, echo=TRUE}


library(readr)
library(mosaic)
library(lattice)
library(datasets)
library(Matrix)
library(mosaicData)

housing_prices <- read_csv("C:/Users/LORD DANNICUS/Desktop/housing-prices.csv")
View(housing_prices)

hp <- read.csv("C:/Users/LORD DANNICUS/Desktop/housing-prices.csv", 
                 header = TRUE)

print.data.frame(hp)

#1-Data set no.17 to be removed as there is no value recorded
hpa <- hp[-17,] 

#2-Main data set to be analysed
print(hpa)

#3-Statistical analysis of data 
favstats(interest_rate~median_house_price_USD, data=hpa)

#4-Pearson's product-moment correlation
hpb<- cor.test(hpa$interest_rate, hpa$median_house_price_USD,
               method = 'pearson')
print(hpb)

LR <- lm(hpa)

summary(LR)# 5-Strong significantly negative association between variables 

plot(hpa, main = "Correlation between Interest Rate and Median House Prices")
#6-Inaccurate plot, as a result further tests required to test distribution of data

text(9.38, 300000,labels = 'r = -0.5766386', col = 'red')
text(9.29, 288000,labels = 'p = 0.01937', col = 'red')

#7-Now we go onto the diagmostic plots for the tests for normal distribution and homoskedasticy.

#8-According to this diagnostic plot we observe that there is a linear relationship between the resduals which therefore tests the linear regression model for normal distribution.
qqnorm(LR$residuals, main = "Normal Q-Q Plot")  
qqline(LR$residuals, col = "red")


plot( x = LR$fitted, y = LR$residuals, main = 'Heteroskedasticy plot')
abline(h = 0, col = 'red')
#9-This plot of residuals shows an uneven slope of residuals so here we obseve that the data meets the criteria of heteroskedaticy I.e:uneven sample population is used.
```

###Data interpretation
####As per the data collected we see that higher interest rates are associated with cheaper houses (See 'Correlation between Interest Rate and Median House Prices' plot).  According to the tests performed we see that not all the assumtions are met for a Linear regression model. The data desplays a significantly negative relationship (r = -0.5766, p = 0.01937) with deviation from the normal, furthermore heteroskedaticy is observed which tells us that there is an abnormal/uneven distribution within the sample population used. As a reult a linear regression model should not be used despite (Im)test results being in favour of this model.
